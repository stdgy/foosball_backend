# JSON Foosball API

## Description
Attempting to adhere to the pseudo-spec at: http://jsonapi.org/

This project is meant to be a learning experience. Just an excuse to investigate
constructing a JSON API using Python and Flask. It's part of a larger exercise which
I guess I'll call *My 12 Months of Code*. This year's New Year's Resolution was to start
and a new coding project at the begininng of each month, and complete it by
the end of the month. I thought I'd spend the first few months with projects oriented
around Foosball, since we tend to play a lot of Foosball at work... 

First month is the back-end. Next month is a JS Client. Next month after that will be
either a desktop or mobile client. And that's as far as I've planned so far!
